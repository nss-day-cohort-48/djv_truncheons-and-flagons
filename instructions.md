    ##Instructions

    -Six flagons of ale, mead, or wine are be arranged on a table. Four flagons making the corners of a square, and the fifth and sixth being placed in the middle of the square. The table should be in an area of a tavern where the teams had some ability to move around.
    -There are three teams of three players in a game of Truncheon & Flagons.
    -There are three roles during the game:
      -The Knights
        -Each Knight has their own small wooden ball to throw into one of the flagons.
        -Each Knight that successfully throws a ball into a flagon earns 2 points for the Knights.
        -Each Knight that successfully throws a ball that lands on the table earns 1 point for the Knights.
      -The Goblins
        -Goblins guard the flagons by swinging small truncheons to knock the ball out of the air before it landed in a flagon or on the table.
        -Each Goblin that successfully knocks a thrown wooden ball out of the air earns 1 point for the Goblins.
      -The Fairies
        -The Fairies can distract the Knights or the Goblins.
        -If a Fairy distract a Knight enough that a ball is dropped, or thrown out of the playing area, the Fairies receive 1 point.
        -If a Fairy distracts a Goblin enough so that a thrown ball lands anywhere in the playing area (on the table or in a flagon) without any defensive truncheon swings, the Fairies receive 1 point.
    -There are three rounds and the teams rotate at the end of each round.
    -At the end of round three, whichever team has the most points earns the honor of drinking the contents of the six flagons.
